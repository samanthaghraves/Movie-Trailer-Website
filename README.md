# Movie Trailer Website

Introduction:
	Hey, everyone! This code is a project coded in Python 
that allows fresh-tomatoes to create an HTML file for a movie
trailer website! Basically it will list all of the movies 
with their poster, and then when you click the poster you get
to watch the trailer!

Required Libraries are Python 2.7

Contents:
	Inside of this application folder you will find:
* .gitattribute
*entertainment_center.py (This is where the movies are)
*fresh_tomatoes.HTML (This is autogenerated by fresh_tomatoes.py)
*fresh_tomatoes.py (This creates the website)
*fresh_tomatoes.pyc
*media.py (This is where the classes are described)
*media.pyc
*README.MD (You are here)

Operating Instructions:
	After cloning or downloading this git and folder, 
in order to run the website, you simply need to run 
entertainment_center.py, and it will automatically open the
fresh_tomatoes.html file in your browser, allowing you to 
run the code. Modifications will all work on refreshing page
as well.
